# Secure-Chat-App

This project is part of Network Security coursework at IIT Jammu. It implements a Secure Chat Application that allows two parties (client and server) to exchange encrypted messages over a TCP connection.

Features:

1) AES-128 Encryption: Provides confidentiality for all chat messages.

2) HMAC-SHA256 Integrity: Each message is authenticated and verified using HMAC to prevent tampering.

3) ECDHE Key Exchange: A fresh ephemeral key pair is generated by both sides for each session to derive a shared secret.

4) RSA Signatures for Authentication: Each side signs its ECDHE parameters with its long-term RSA private key.
The other side verifies this signature using the stored public key, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

5) HKDF-Based Rekeying: After every 10 messages (sent or received in total), new AES and HMAC keys are derived using HKDF from the old keys.

## How to Run

1. Generate RSA key pairs for client and server using (client_key.py) and (server_key.py).
2. Exchange public keys between client and server folders.
3. Start the server (server.py), then run the client (client.py).
4. Begin chatting securely. Type exit to close the connection.
